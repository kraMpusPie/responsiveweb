      <h2>My Gears!</h2>
      <br>
      <h4> Here are the gears that I'm using whenenver I take some photos:</h4>
      <h3 style="margin-left: 11cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-bottom: .5%; margin-top: 5%;">Nikon D5300</h3>
        <img src="img/d5300.jpg" alt="d5300" style="width: 360px; height: 240px;">
      <p id="custom">
        This is the only camera that I have right now; in fact, this camera is actually my father's. It's a decent camera for hobbyists, but not on the professional side. 
        It has a 24.4 MP sensor, can shoot videos up to 1080p at 60 fps, and a Wide Viewing angle vari-angle TFT-LCD. As long as it does the job, I will keep using it.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 style="margin-left: 11cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-bottom: .5%; margin-top: 5%;">Nikkor 18-55mm f3.5-5.6</h3>
      <img src="img/1855mm.jpg" alt="1855mm" style="width: 360px; height: 240px;">
      <p id="custom">This kit lens came with the D5300 as a bundle, just like its body; it's a pretty decent lens if you're using it for travel, family gatherings, hobbies, etc.
        I would not recommend this lens for professional work because of its f-stop or aperture.</p>
        <br>
      <h3 style="margin-left: 11cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-bottom: .5%; margin-top: 5%;">Nikkor 70-300mm f4-5.6</h3>
      <img src="img/70300mm.jpg" alt="70300" style="width: 360px; height: 240px;">
      <p id="custom"> I'm currently using this telephoto lens as my primary lens. It does the job well, but it suffers whenever I zoom it from 100 to 300mm.
        It lacks vibration reduction (VR). See my Gallery for sample photos; all of those pictures were taken with this lens except for one picture; guess which one.</p>
      <br>
      <hr style="margin-top: 5%;">
      <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;"> Here are the gears that I wish I have right now: (Soon, maybe...)</h4>
      <h3 style="margin-left: 11cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-bottom: .5%; margin-top: 5%;">Sony A7 Mark II</h3>
      <img src="img/a7ii.jpg" alt="a7ii" style="width: 360px; height: 240px; margin-top: -1%;">
      <p id="custom"> The Sony A7 Mark II is one of the best entry-level full-frame mirrorless cameras.
        It has the same 24.4MP sensor but in full frame, a better processor compared to my D5300, and in-body stabilization.
        Though even I want this camera, it lacks some features too, like a vari-angle touch screen, an extra SD Card slot, and updated technology like faster auto-focus.
        Nonetheless, it is still a good starter if you want to start in a better field of photography.</p>
        <br>
      <h3 style="margin-left: 11cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-bottom: .5%; margin-top: 5%;">Sony A7R Mark V</h3>
      <img src="img/a7rv.jpg" alt="a7rv" style="width: 360px; height: 240px; margin-top: -1%;">
      <p id="custom">The Sony A7R Mark V is one of the best top-of-the-line full-frame mirrorless cameras.
        It has a 61MP sensor, the best processor in the market equipped with a newly developed AI feature for real-time tracking, and can shoot videos up to 8K at 24 fps.
        It is one of the best full-frame mirrorless cameras that you can buy. This is my top pick for cameras.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 11cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-bottom: .5%; margin-top: 5%;">E-Mount Prime Lenses like the 35mm, 50mm, and 85mm</h3>
      <img src="img/85mm.jpg" alt="85mm" style="width: 360px; height: 240px; margin-top: -1%;">
      <p id="custom">To achieve that creamy bokeh or crisp and fast focus, it also requires better glasses.
        For me, these three prime lenses have the perfect amount of diameter with a fast aperture like f1.4 or at least f1.8.
        Though it costs a lot of money to afford brands like the G-Master or the Sigma (cheaper alternatives like Samyang, Viltrox, etc.),
        it's all worth it when you see the perfect outcome.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5cm; text-align: center;">Well, that's it for my gears. How about yours? Can you share it with me? You can send me an email through my Contact page.</h4>
