        I will not talk about my whole life here in this blog, and I will just give you a glimpse of some of the things I can remember.
        I'm the firstborn child of our family, and I have three siblings. I was born and raised here in Lucena City, Quezon Province, and my whole life did circle around this place until 2018.
        After my SHS graduation, I moved to Marikina for my 2-year media training, and before our completion, the pandemic suddenly arrived with the implementation of lockdown in the whole country, exactly on my birthday!
        During those following years or pandemic days, my life was stagnant; there was no progress and no where to start. Until I tried to take my chance to have an entrance exam and enroll for my College and fortunately passed it, 
        and here I am in my second year of college.

      <h3>What I enjoy the most!</h3>
      <p style="color: #666; text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm;">
        <img src="img/cam.png" alt="cam.me" style="width: 240px; height: 144px; float: right; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: .5cm;">
        Photography is my passion, a creative journey that allows me to freeze fleeting moments and express my perspective on the world. 
        Through my camera lens, I capture the beauty in everyday life, telling stories and connecting with others beyond words. It brings me joy, continuous growth, 
        and an appreciation for the wonders that surround us. Photography is not just a hobby; it's a part of who I am. <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, photography serves as a canvas for my artistic expression. 
        It allows me to play with light, colors, and composition to create captivating images that resonate with emotions. 
        With every click, I find fulfillment in freezing time and preserving cherished memories. 
        Photography pushes me to explore new places, seek unique perspectives, and connect with diverse communities. 
        It's an endless journey of learning and evolving, and through it, I discover more about myself and the world around me. 
        Photography is not just a passion; it's an endless source of inspiration that fuels my creativity and enriches my life in countless ways.
